# Kaboo
### Setup
Each player starts with four cards, placed face-down and arranged into a two-by-two grid. No one may look at any cards during this process.

At the beginning of the game, all players will look at their bottom two cards (the ones closest to them) once. Try to remember your cards.

To call Kaboo, you should have at least completed 3 turns.

We will have a sanity check (timer) for each turn and power-ups.

### Objective
The objective is to end the game with a hand of the lowest aggregate value. The score is determined by summing up the value of each of your cards.

#### Card Values:
Ace -> 1
Remaining Cards -> 2 - 10 (Depending on Value)
Jack -> 11
Queen -> 12
King -> 13
King of Diamonds (Specifically) -> 0

#### Card Powerups:
1 through 6 are the “low cards”. They have a low point value and are fairly desirable.

7 through King are the “power cards”. You will not want to keep them for their points, but if you draw one on your turn you can choose to use its power. Here are the unique power-ups assigned to each of these cards below:

7, 8 -> You can see one of your own cards.
9, 10 -> You can see one of your opponent’s cards.
Jacks -> You can blindly swap one of your cards with one of your opponent’s cards.
Queens -> You can see one of your own cards, but you cannot see your opponent's card, and you can swap any two cards of your choosing. The cards you swap don’t necessarily have to be the two you viewed.
Kings -> You’re able to see one of your own cards, one of your opponent’s cards, and have the ability to swap any two cards of your choosing. The cards you swap don’t necessarily have to be the two you viewed.

### Gameplay
The player that goes first will be randomized.

On your turn, you must draw a card from the deck (the face-down pile).
After drawing the card, you have a few different options at your disposal:

Swap the drawn card with one of your own cards. This situation occurs when the value of the drawn card is less than one of the cards in your hand. You may also discard one of the cards that’s not visible; however, there’s a chance you may end up discarding a more favorable card.
Play the card you drew. This situation occurs when you play the card you picked up. If it happens to be one of the designated “power-up” cards, you will be able to use its power-up. 
Intercept Yourself: If you have a duplicate of the card you picked up, you’re allowed to discard both cards and gain another prioritized turn. This turn will happen before resuming the natural flow of the game. The action of intercepting allows you to entirely discard one of the cards in your hand, providing you an advantage in the long run.

Sometimes, memories fail. If you mess up while matching, you must take a penalty card for each mistake. You cannot look at the penalty card.

Here are the actions you can take as a third party while other players are taking their respective turn:

### Intercepts:
Intercept Yourself: If you have a duplicate of the card you picked up, you’re allowed to discard both cards and gain another prioritized turn. This turn will happen before resuming the natural flow of the game. The action of intercepting allows you to entirely discard one of the cards in your hand, providing you an advantage in the long run.
Intercept a 3rd party: This situation occurs when you have the same card values to that of the discarded card by another player. You can intercept and get an extra turn and other players have to wait until you complete your intercept turn also you get rid of one card.
As a 3rd party, intercept 3rd party: If someone plays a card, and you know that another (or the same) person has the same card value, you can take it and discard it. 

### End Game
If at any point during a person’s turn they call “Kaboo”, everyone except for that person gets one more turn and then the game ends.

There are two other ways the game may end:

Someone runs out of cards (they match their last card).
The deck runs out (alternatively you could re-shuffle and keep playing).
The lowest total score wins (see objective).
